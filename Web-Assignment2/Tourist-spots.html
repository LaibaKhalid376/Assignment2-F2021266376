                  The lake was formed when Attabad village in <strong>Hunza Valley in Gilgit−Baltistan</strong> had a landslide, 14 kilometres 
                  (9 mi) upstream (east) of Karimabad that occurred on 4 January 2010. The landslide killed twenty people and 
                  blocked the flow of the Hunza River for five months. The lake flooding displaced 6,000 people from upstream 
                  villages, stranded (from land transportation routes) a further 25,000, and inundated over 19 kilometres (12 mi) 
                  of the Karakoram Highway. The lake reached 21 kilometres (13 mi) long and over 100 metres (330 ft) in depth 
                  by the first week of June 2010 when it began flowing over the landslide dam, completely submerging lower Shishkat
                   and partly flooding Gulmit.
