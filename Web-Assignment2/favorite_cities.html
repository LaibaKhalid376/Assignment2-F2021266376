              Skardu is a city located in Gilgitâˆ’Baltistan, Pakistan, and serves as the capital 
              of Skardu District and the Baltistan Division. Skardu is situated at an elevation of nearly 2,500 metres in the Skardu Valley, at the 
              confluence of the Indus and Shigar Rivers.The city is an important gateway to the eight-thousanders of the nearby Karakoram mountain range. 
              Skardu features a <strong>cold semi-arid climate</strong>.
              The climate of Skardu during the summer is moderated by its mountain setting. The mountains 
              block out the summer monsoon, and summer rainfall is thus quite low. However, these mountains result in very severe winter weather. During the 
              April-to-October tourist season.
